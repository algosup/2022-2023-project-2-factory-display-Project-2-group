### 2. Overview

Jacobi's[^1] company commissioned us to create a communication tool to centralize the information to be transmitted to all employee.

Actually, the company share and send the informations via different application like Team, Email or Yammer, but also with a paper display. The company would like to facilitate communication and make it more topical with the digital tools that exist.
